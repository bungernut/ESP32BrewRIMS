# ESP32BrewREMS

# Documentation
I dont know why, but it's been a real pain to find documentation for the ESP32 device. I'm using a HiLetgo ESP32 OLED WiFi Kit V3. This is apparently really a product by Heltec: https://heltec.org/project/wifi-kit32-v3/

USB-Serial Driver: https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

This library seems to be really important https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32


None of their links work, so I'm going to try to scrape together what I can find:

### Encoder Input
I should have looked at the spec sheet. I think the circuit is close w/ the input pullup:
